FLIGHT_FARE_PREDICTION

In this project We predict the Flights Fare using the Flight Source, Destination, Time, Stops,..... which 90% of the attributes are Strings(Objects)

Exploratory Analysis, Data(objects - -> int) Conversion using Encoders, HyperTuned using RandomizedSearchCV and the Model is Fitted using RandomForestRegressor
and our model was saved using Pickle and Joblib Frameworks

Note: I can't upload the models, because Github can't upload a file more than 25mb, 
      But you download all the folders. you can run the saving models cells and it will saved in the Model Folder
      
      
THANK YOU!!!
