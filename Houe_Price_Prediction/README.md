---------House Price Prediction---------

In this project i have predicted Banglore House Prices.

This Banglore House Dataset has many Categorical Data and Outliers

I have done different Exploratory Data Analysis techniques, Data Cleaning, Cross Value Check, Hyper-Parameter Tuning, Model Fitting and Trained the Model

This is an very intresting project, where many techniques used for removing outliers, converting meaningful data

Finally i have used two methods to save the model.

Note: I have created a Model Folder, where our model saved. Model folder is empty.
      when you execute the code your model will saved in that foldeer
      

THANK YOU !!!
