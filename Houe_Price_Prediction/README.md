---------House Price Prediction---------

💢 In this project i have predicted Banglore House Prices.

💢 This Banglore House Dataset has many Categorical Data and Outliers

💢 I have done different Exploratory Data Analysis techniques, Data Cleaning, Cross Value Check, Hyper-Parameter Tuning, Model Fitting and Trained the Model

💢 This is an very intresting project, where many techniques used for removing outliers, converting meaningful data

💢 Finally i have used two methods to save the model.

          when you execute the code your model will saved in that foldeer
